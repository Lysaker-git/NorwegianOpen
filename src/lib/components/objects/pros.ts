Their journey began in 2017 when they first connected on the dance floor—though it wasn’t love at first (left side) pass.

      `In 2017 Attila was introduced to West Coast Swing and instantly fell in love with the dance. The ability to improvise and interpret music spontaneously was something he always felt was lacking in ballroom dances. Filled with motivation, he started competing in WCS at his first event and reached the All-Star division 2.5 years later – each competition surrounded by massive amounts of social dancing. The love for all the aspects of this dance has been growing ever since and soon WCS became the main focus of his dancing career. Since he never misses out on a chance to social-dance, he usually sleeps during the day at events.`,
      `On his journey as a dancer Attila has worked with different international top teachers and coaches and took classes as well as private lessons in other dance styles such as Salsa, Bachata, Lindy Hop, Ballet, etc., always eager to broaden his knowledge and finding new pieces he could implement in his dancing.`,
      `Attila has been teaching and choreographing since 2012 in the styles Standard, Latin, Salsa, and of course more recently, West Coast Swing. “Sharing my passion and knowledge with other dancers means not only teaching but also learning for myself – and it is as rewarding as it gets.”`    ]

      `Ardena’s journey with dance began with salsa and took off during two years of ballroom dancing in the USA. In 2010, she discovered West Coast Swing and immediately felt like she’d found her "dance home.” Since then, she’s been on a mission to grow the WCS community in Norway, learning from the best around the world and bringing that knowledge back. She runs weekly classes and socials at Westie Wednesday in Oslo, still fostering the community she loves so much. Ardena is also the Event Director of Winter White, a WSDC event for 10 years, and Sol Swing since 2019.`,
      `With a background in psychology, fitness and yoga, she brings a unique, well-rounded style to her teaching. But what really excites her is digging deep into the details of WCS; teaching those little details that feel complex and can take a dancer’s skills to the next level.`,
      `For Ardena, teaching isn’t just about learning moves. It’s about helping people grow and seeing them light up when they find themselves, becoming more confident and more connected to their bodies and to music. When not dancing or teaching, Ardena loves to spend time with her husband and daughter out in nature.`    ]
