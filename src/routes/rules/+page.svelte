              <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-semibold">WSDC Points Registry:</strong> WSDC Jack & Jill skill levels (Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, All-Star) are determined by the official WSDC Points Registry (<a href="https://www.worldsdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">WSDC Points Registry</a>).</p>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-semibold">Competitor Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for knowing the divisions you are eligible for based on your WSDC points in both Leader and Follower roles. You must use your unique WSDC Competitor ID number when registering.</p>
              <p class="mb-2"><strong class="font-semibold">Primary & Secondary Roles:</strong> Competitors may enter a maximum of two WSDC skill-level Jack & Jill competitions: once in their primary role and once in their secondary role.</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Your competition level is determined by your points in that specific role.</li>

                <li>You must maintain your chosen role (Leader or Follower) throughout all rounds of a single competition. Role switching during a competitive dance is generally not permitted for more than 8 beats.</li>

                WSDC Roles, Main & Secondary Role Guidance
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-3">WSDC differentiates points and levels by dance role: Leader and Follower. Your <strong>Main Role</strong> is the role where you hold the majority of your points; your <strong>Secondary Role</strong> is the other role.</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Main Role:</strong> Your WSDC level in your main role determines your primary eligibility. This is the role where your official WSDC points are highest.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Role:</strong> You may enter competitions in a secondary role subject to WSDC rules — generally you may compete up to one level lower in your secondary role than your main role, but specific limits depend on current WSDC policy. Always verify your eligibility on the WSDC registry.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> If your Main Role is Intermediate, you may enter Intermediate (main role) and potentially Novice (secondary) subject to WSDC rules and event-specific restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Point Requirements:</strong> Points are awarded when divisions meet minimum entry thresholds. Ensure you understand the minimum entries required for points and consult the WSDC registry for up-to-date rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Role Switching:</strong> For Jack &amp; Jill, competitors may indicate primary and secondary roles at registration. Role switching during a single competitive heat is discouraged and limited by competition rules (typically not more than 8 beats where applicable).</li>
                <li><strong>Disputes & Petitions:</strong> If you believe your WSDC points are incorrect or a reclassification is warranted, follow the petition process. Decisions by the Chief Judge are final.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mb-2">If you are unsure about your WSDC level or eligibility, check the WSDC Points Registry or contact the Chief Judge prior to registering for competitions.</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-semibold">Lead/Follow:</strong> Jack & Jill and Strictly Swing competitions emphasize spontaneous, lead/follow dancing. Pre-choreographed routines or significant amounts of choreographed sequences are not permitted in these divisions.</p>
