        <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-semibold">WSDC Points Registry:</strong> WSDC Jack & Jill skill levels (Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, All-Star) are determined by the official WSDC Points Registry (<a href="https://www.worldsdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">WSDC Points Registry</a>).</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong class="font-semibold">Competitor Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for knowing the divisions you are eligible for based on your WSDC points in both Leader and Follower roles. You must use your unique WSDC Competitor ID number when registering.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong class="font-semibold">Primary & Secondary Roles:</strong> Competitors may enter a maximum of two WSDC skill-level Jack & Jill competitions: once in their primary role and once in their secondary role.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Your competition level is determined by your points in that specific role.</li>
          <li>Generally, you may compete one or two levels lower in your secondary role than your primary role's WSDC-defined level, subject to WSDC rules (e.g., Intermediate primary dancers cannot compete in Newcomer secondary). Check current WSDC guidelines for specifics.</li>
          <li>You must maintain your chosen role (Leader or Follower) throughout all rounds of a single competition. Role switching during a competitive dance is generally not permitted for more than 8 beats.</li>

          III. Petitioning for Division Reclassification
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If you believe you should compete in a WSDC skill level division other than the one dictated by your current points (for your primary role only), you may submit a petition.

            <strong class="font-semibold">Petition Down:</strong> To compete one level lower than your current points indicate (primary role only), submit a formal petition request to the Chief Judge two weeks before event start. A committee including the Chief Judge will review your WSDC record. Approval is granted on an event-by-event basis. (

        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong class="font-semibold">Decisions Final:</strong> All decisions regarding petitions made by the Chief Judge or competition officials are final. Be prepared to compete in your originally qualified division if your petition is denied.
