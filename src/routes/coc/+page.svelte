                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Respect Boundaries & Consent:</strong> Everyone has the right to control their own physical space and interactions. Be mindful of your partners and those around you. It's always okay to decline a dance, and no explanation is required. Be gracious whether asking or declining. Do not pressure anyone into dancing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Dance Roles:</strong> We support dancers choosing any role (lead, follow, or switching) they prefer, regardless of gender.

                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Floor Craft & Safety:</strong> Be aware of your surroundings and your partner. Prioritize safety to avoid collisions. If accidental contact occurs, apologize immediately. Aerials, lifts, drops, or other weight-support moves that could be unsafe in a social setting are generally not permitted on the social floor unless explicitly agreed upon by both partners *and* executed with extreme care for surroundings. When in doubt, leave it out.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Feedback:</strong> Refrain from offering unsolicited advice or instruction on the social dance floor or during workshops unless specifically asked or if there is an immediate safety concern. Teaching is for designated classes.
                  </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Hygiene & Allergens:</strong> Good personal hygiene is expected. Please be mindful that strong perfumes, colognes, or other scented products can cause issues for those with allergies or sensitivities; use them sparingly or avoid them. Consider bringing extra shirts if you tend to sweat significantly.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Inclusivity in Action:</strong> Make an effort to be welcoming, especially to newcomers. A friendly smile or asking someone new to dance can make a big difference.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold">Respect Staff & Venue:</strong> Treat event staff, volunteers, venue personnel, and fellow attendees with courtesy and respect. Follow any specific venue rules regarding food, drink, smoking, etc.
